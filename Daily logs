Day1: FreecodeCamp (May 30,2017)
-completion of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
Was hard for me to pick up the initial working model and structure. But slowly picked it up.

Day 2:May 31st, 2017
-Some revision on HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and completion of Jquery
Was fun going through all the hours of coding i had done and then pick up some new lessons. Pretty pumped up to start with creating my own webpage now.
