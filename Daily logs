Day1: FreecodeCamp (May 30,2017)
-completion of HTML, CSS and Bootstrap
Was hard for me to pick up the initial working model and structure. But slowly picked it up.

Day 2:May 31st, 2017
-Some revision on HTML, CSS and Bootstrap and completion of Jquery
Was fun going through all the hours of coding i had done and then pick up some new lessons. Pretty pumped up to start with creating my own webpage now.

Day 3: June 1st, 2017
-completed all the initial learning of HTML, CSS, Bootstrap and Jquery. Started working on the Tribute page challenge in FCC.
A lot of issues trying to figure out stuff on my own. Read/Ask/watch is helping a bit but still a lot of confusion. Sticking to it for now.
